SLAB | Horror Dining Immersion Project


SLAB is a fictional horror-themed dining experience website. This project was inspired by "The Haunted House Restaurant" (https://thehauntedrestaurant.com/). This website is uses original 
images, and i also changed the name of the pages to reflect the feel of my inspired project.

I made a style.css page that carries the same nav bar and footer to everypage. My nav bar has a total of six working hyperlinks. The nav bar also has a built in hamburger button so that it is mobile responsive and has been tested.

The home page i built follows the layout of my inspiration page with a very similair nav bar, similair syled hero section, and main section. On my Plot-Picker page i built a reservation form. 
The form includes 3 drop downs one for selecting the date, one for selecting the time, and one for sececting the amount of spirits(guests). I also including a submit button"Open Plot". On the 
boo-tique page i built a cart table. The table displys five columns: item, quantity, price, subtotal, and an action. The user can choose items to add to cart from the cards above and then 
inside the table see the price of each item, a total price, an option to adjust quantities, and a remove item button. The cart actually funtions with the linked cart.js javescript. a few of the 
bootstrap components implemented are the navbar component to make it responsive to have the same layout on all pages, also adding the hamburger button for mobile responsiveness. On the boo-tique
age i used card components to display the merchandise items, and also made sure the cards would respond to a mobile screen and adjust layout accordingly. I also used a table component on the 
boo-tique page to align the shopping cart system, and also make sure the table would adjust for mobile screens.

I also created a jstest.html which is located in my main folder with the other html. This page just allows you to see the four javascript funtions i came up with for future use. The first one is
a mystery dish generator. It would go on the menu page as a fun way to order food without making choices. There are just a few random silly dish names for thetest purpose. The second funtion is 
a gift card generator that would be attached to the death tickets page. It just generates a random promo code but could be a way to allow customers to recieve a surprise in an email if on a 
mailing list for access to generate a discount code. The third is a reservation validator and would be attached to the plot picker page. It would just be a logging system to work with the open plot reservation form. The last function is a Seance request logger. Just retrieves names once put in for a waitlist.
